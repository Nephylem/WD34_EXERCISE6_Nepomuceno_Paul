                    <h3>Ata</h3>
                    <p>Ata tribal houses are usually built of round timbers. Their homes are elevated to prevent attacks in times of pangayaw (clan wars). They also fashion their stairs out of a single piece of sturdy round timber so it can be easily kept during night time to block the enemies from breaking in. The design of Ata homes are also distinct for the bundle of cogon grass or manok-manok adorning their roofs. These homes are found in the districts of Marilog and Paquibato and other neighboring areas of Davao City.</p>

                    <p>The tribe is known as the people who live peacefully at sea. One of the new things you can see within their house is the “Lepa.” It’s a type of traditional boat used by Sama tribe during festivals and weddings. The Lepa displayed in their house was given by Vice President Duterte when she was still a mayor. The Lepa she gave was a gift from the people of Tawi-Tawi during their Lepa Festival in 2019.</p>
